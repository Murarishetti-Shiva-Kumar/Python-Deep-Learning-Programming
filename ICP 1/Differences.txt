State differences between Python 2 and Python 3 version.

In Python 3, the print statement has been replaced with a print () function
Ex: In Python 2 it is print “hello” but in Python 3 it is print (“hello”)


 Integer division returns float values in python 3.x and integer values in 2.x
 Ex:
    print 7 / 5
    print -7 / 5

    Output in Python 3.x :
    1.4
    -1.4

    Output in Python 2.x
    1
    -2

In Python 3, default storing of strings is Unicode.
In python 2, to store Unicode string value, you require to define them with "u".

In Python 3, Range() function is introduced to perform iterations.
In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations.
